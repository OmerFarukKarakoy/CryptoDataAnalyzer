## 🧠 Overview

The tool utilizes a three-tiered trend detection system (EMA, ADX, Swing Analysis) and dynamically identifies support/resistance levels using:
- Historical major/minor swing points
- Fibonacci retracements
- EMA levels (50/200)
- Psychological price levels

**Trend Detection System:**
- **📈 Yükseliş (Uptrend)**: All indicators suggest bullish movement
- **🔻 Düşüş (Downtrend)**: Strong bearish consensus across indicators
- **🔄 Yatay (Sideways)**: Inconclusive trend; price consolidation likely
- **❓ Belirsiz (Uncertain)**: Weak or noisy signal, further confirmation needed

- ✅ **Multi-Timeframe Support/Resistance Detection** (1H, 4H, 1D, 1W)
- ✅ **EMA (50 / 200)** Dynamic Levels per timeframe
- ✅ **ADX + Swing High/Low + EMA Combo Trend Detection**
- ✅ **Fibonacci retracement overlays**
- ✅ **Psychological level mapping**
- ✅ **Auto-prioritization of support/resistance levels**
- ✅ **Custom visual chart rendering (matplotlib)**
- ✅ **Adaptive strategy selection based on timeframe**

## 🔍 Analysis Methodology

### 📊 Multi-Factor Convergence System
This tool employs a weighted scoring algorithm that synthesizes data from:

#### 1. Trend Detection Layer
```mermaid
graph TD
    A[EMA Cross] --> B[50EMA > 200EMA = Bullish]
    A --> C[50EMA < 200EMA = Bearish]
    D[ADX] --> E[>25 = Strong Trend]
    D --> F[<20 = Weak Trend]
    G[Swing Fractals] --> H[Higher Highs/Lows = Uptrend]
    G --> I[Lower Highs/Lows = Downtrend]
```
